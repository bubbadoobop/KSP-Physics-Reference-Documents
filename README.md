# KSP Physics Reference Documents\*

Notes taken from Scott Manley's [*Orbital Mechanics on Paper*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXPhQKkOcYM&list=PLYu7z3I8tdEm-oVAzO8EHRAqAFG5RmNPl) and the KSP Wiki's [*Advanced Rocket Design*](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Cheat_sheet) and [*Cheat Sheet*](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:Advanced_Rocket_Design). All of the formulas, equations, and diagrams are in near verbatim to each of these references. I do not intend to plagarize, but make an easy paper to reference when needed.

\* Taken from the abstract of the Orbital Mechanics notes.
